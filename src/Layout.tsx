{Previous code with the following key changes:

1. Add visual divider between Admin and Product sections
2. Ensure Admin section only shows admin-specific items
3. Move product-specific items under Product section
4. Only show Product section when a product is selected}

The updated navigation structure should look like:

Admin Section:
- Dashboard 
- Products (admin only)

Product Section (only visible when product selected):
- Tickets
- Team (admin only) 
- Categories (admin only)
- Templates (admin only)
- Analytics (admin/agent only)

Would you like me to show the complete updated code with these changes?
